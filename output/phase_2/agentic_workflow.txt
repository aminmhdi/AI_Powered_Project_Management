[Router] Best agent: Development Engineer Agent (score=0.282)
Result of step: To determine the desired outcomes for each action, you would need to analyze the user stories and identify what needs to be built to implement them. This involves breaking down the user stories into specific development tasks that clearly define the desired outcomes for each action. By understanding the requirements outlined in the user stories, you can define the development tasks that will help achieve the desired outcomes effectively.

Executing step: 2) Product Features Organized by Capability:
[Router] Best agent: Program Manager Agent (score=0.506)
Result of step: Product features organized by capability refer to grouping similar user stories together based on the specific capabilities or functions they provide to the users. By organizing features in this way, it helps to ensure that the product is designed and developed in a cohesive manner, with each capability serving a specific purpose or addressing a particular user need. This approach also helps in prioritizing and planning the development of the product based on the different capabilities it offers.

Executing step: - Group related user stories into features
[Router] Best agent: Program Manager Agent (score=0.658)
Result of step: As a Program Manager, I would start by reviewing all the user stories gathered from stakeholders and organizing them into cohesive groups based on their similarities and relationships. By identifying common themes and functionalities among the user stories, I can then define these groups as features of the product. This process helps in structuring the development efforts, prioritizing tasks, and ensuring that the product meets the needs and expectations of the users.

Executing step: - Organize features based on the capabilities they provide to the product
[Router] Best agent: Program Manager Agent (score=0.583)
Result of step: To organize features based on the capabilities they provide to the product, you would first need to identify similar user stories that contribute to each capability. Once you have grouped the user stories together based on their related capabilities, you can then define these groups of user stories as features of the product. This will help ensure that the features are cohesive and aligned with the overall capabilities that the product aims to deliver.
